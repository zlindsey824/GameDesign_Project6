Project no: #5

Project due date: 8 AM Monday, April 22nd, 2019

Project description: Add an Object Pool, Explosions, Projectiles,
                     Sound and Music.

The easiest part of this project: Implementing the music because we only really had to rename what files were used.

Problems that I had in completing this project: Getting bullets and explosions to work properly

Where did I get my Sound and Music? We made all of our own sounds using Bfxr and FL Studio

What Objects did I pool? We pooled our bullets because that made the most sense for us to implement.
