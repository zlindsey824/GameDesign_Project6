Project description:
	We added a conclusion to our game by making the oal to shoot all the balloons
	without blowing up (getting touched by a balloon) 3 times. One of our hiccups 
	was getting the balloons to actually blow up but not respawn. However, we 
	fixed that by adjusting the explosionDone function.

The Pizzazz feature that I added:
Based on the examples provided, our pizzazz would be the menu.
